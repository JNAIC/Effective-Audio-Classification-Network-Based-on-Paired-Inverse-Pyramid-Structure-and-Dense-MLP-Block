## The repetition procedure goes in this way:
* Preprocess Your UrbanSound8k Data into five features with size of (399,100) by virutal of Spafe Lib (as it is shown in the code)
* Load the Model and Processed Data into your computer memory for less training time.
* **Wait until the training process finishes.**
# The results have been updated in the new version of arxiv, the comparison code will be released once the thesis is updated. The new experiments solve the problem proposed in the Issues.
