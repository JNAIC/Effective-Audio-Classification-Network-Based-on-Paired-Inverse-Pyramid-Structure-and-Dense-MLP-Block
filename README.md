## The repetition procedure goes in this way:
* Preprocess Your UrbanSound8k Data into five features with size of (399,100) by virutal of Spafe Lib (as it is shown in the code)
* Load the Model and Processed Data into your computer memory for less training time.
* Wait until the training process finishes.
## The thesis is under the peer review of IEEE ICASSP and is available on the Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02940
