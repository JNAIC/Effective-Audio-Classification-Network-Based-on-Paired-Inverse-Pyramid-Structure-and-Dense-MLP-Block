## The procedure goes in this way:
* Preprocess Your UrbanSound8k Data into five features with size of (399,100) by virutal if Spafe
* Load the Model and Processed Data into your computer memory for less training time.
* Wait until the training process completed.
## The thesis is under the peer review of IEEE ICASSP and is going to be preprinted on the arxiv soon
